# WineAnalysis

WineAnalysis is a descriptive and predictive tool for interpreting the results of chemical wine data. It contains several descriptive visualizations of this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality . It also contains an interactive random forest reggression model which successfully predicts the quality score of a wine based on an input of 11 chemical parameters. 

Click the "launch binder" button below to launch the wine analysis dashboard. Please allow time for the tool to build as it will need to install the necessary requirements and run the code chunks contained in WineAnalysis.ipynb in order to generate the interactive tool.
